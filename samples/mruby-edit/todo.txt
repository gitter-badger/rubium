- Q: Why do some exceptions crash the render process?
  + A: If javascript throws through the C API, you MUST handle the exception
       via ClearException (see mrb_cef_v8_js_object_apply) or stop executing code
       until JavaScript gets control back and handles the exception. This was handled
       in the low-level api by passing a block to apply as an exception handler.
       The method_missing API wasn't doing this, and would go on to execute more
       JavaScript. The exception not being cleared, context->Eval would fail & crash.
       This has been rectified. The method_missing API now rethrows any exceptions
       (well, throws their message anyway) in ruby land. If ruby doesn't catch this,
       it will be re-thrown in JavaScript once the V8 handler catches the ruby
       exception.
- Q: Can we make `enum_for` work with JavaScript iterators? (like jsArray.forEach(&ruby_block))
