Rubium (alpha)
==============

A framework for developing desktop apps with web technologies.

&#x2713; Ruby <br/>
&#x2713; JavaScript <br/>
&#x2713; HTML <br/>
&#x2713; SVG <br/>
&#x2713; CSS <br/>

Rubium is similar in spirit to node-webkit, or atom-shell. It provides a Chromium shell for your
application's UI. This lets you develop your UI like a web app, while giving you access to the underlying
system like a native app.
